Python wrappers for libsystemd API

CHANGES WITH 231:

        * Various build fixes and cleanups: documentation can be
          generated with 'make sphinx-html', pip install works out
          of the box.

        * Tests that cover most of the python code were added. As a
          result, a bug in sd_is_mq was fixed in systemd 227.

        * Functions sd_pid_notify and sd_pid_notify_with_fds are now
          wrapped as optional arguments to notify(), when compiled
          against a new-enough libsystemd.
